## Proyect no. 1 

#### By Andony Zamora, Lester Garcia and Julia Pineda

### October 18th, 2016 

We started reading and undertanding the proyect and we searched for any word that we canÂ´t understand at all. 
We wrote note about the simple data structures that we need for the proyect like:
*Pointers.
*Stacks.
*Tails.
*Load of File


### October 19th, 2016

We started programming our proyect and the first thing that we started was looking how we can make the load of file. 
When we allready know how to do that we started Implementing the code.
