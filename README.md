# Advanced Programming 2016

## Proyect no. 1 

#### By Andony Zamora, Lester Garcia and Julia Pineda

### October 18th, 2016 

We started reading, undertanding and analyzing the proyect. 
We searched for any word that we canÂ´t understand at all. 
We wrote note about the structures that we need for the proyect like:
* Pointers.
* Stacks.
* Tails.
* Load of File.
* Exit and Fail Stack.
* Memory.
* Arrays.
* List.

#### Arrays
  * Collection of data that holds fixed number of values of same type.
  
#### Stacks
 *  Collection in which are kept in order and the principal operations on the collection are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position.
 
#### Tails
 * It is a data structure, characterized by being a sequence of elements in which the operation push its made in one extreme and Extraction Operation pop on the other.
 
#### Memory 
 * Retained, or stored computer data stored for some time. They are three types of memory: 
  * Random access memory
  * Direct access memory
  * Memory register


### October 19th, 2016

We started programming our proyect and the first thing that we started was looking how we can make the load of file. 
When we allready know how to do that we try to started Implementing the code in C++. 


### October 20th, 2016

We analyzed how we can  implement the code in c++ of the fail stack and the exit stack. 

### October 21st, 2016 

We analidze the petition tail, this tail has to run and consume available resources to be completed.

### October 24th, 2016

We made the server 1 and the server 2. 

### October 25th, 2016

We made the server 3. We analize that the DC was not a normal tail, this tail is tail of tail.
